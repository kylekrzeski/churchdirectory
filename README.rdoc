== ChurchDirectory

Blazing through some code to get a nice, printable directory for our church.

I normally have good test coverage, but this is just a proof of concept, so no tests :)

We use churchmembershiponline.com for our membership database.  However, their 
membership directories leave something to be desired.  This allows us to import
the Excel files that they export, and then display it nicely.

NOTE: The ChurchMembershipOnline.com export must be re-saved as a normal .xls first.
